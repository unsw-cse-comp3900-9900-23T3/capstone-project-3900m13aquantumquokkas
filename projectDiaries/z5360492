Week 1
During our tutorial this week I found my group members Armani, Danny, Dylan, and Hayley and formed the team Quantum Quokkas with Hayley being our Scrum Master. We promptly decided on our group project: Twitter Fake News Detection and discussed how we would approach this project and what language and model we would use. We set up Jira and also a discord server where we can communicate efficiently.

Week 2
This week we realised there was and issue with the Twitter API outlined in the project specs and after consulting with another group doing the same project, we emailed our client to arrange a meeting to discuss this issue and get clarification on the project requirements. Aside from this, we delegated work between the team to work on the proposal report, preparing to have a draft ready by next week's meeting. 

Week 3
After meeting with the client alongside the other group, we have been granted access to Twitter and LIWC and the meeting with the client will be repeated on a weekly basis to for project updates and discussion. We have since found another issue being that LIWC supports CLI and not API, which will be discussed with the client next week. Our team revised and finalised our proposal report, and was finally submitted. Our next tutorial meeting would be on a public holiday and hence rearranged to an online meeting week 4 Friday.
