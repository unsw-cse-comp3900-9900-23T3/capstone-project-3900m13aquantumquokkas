                    Welcome to TruthGuard AI! At the heart of our mission is a dedication to combating the spread of misinformation on one of the world's most influential social media platforms.
                    <p id="paragraph">Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing and deep learning, we harnessed the capabilities of LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) and PyTorch to create a robust tool for identifying and flagging fake news on Twitter. </p>
                    <p id="paragraph"> Our project is the result of the collaborative efforts of a group of five passionate students from the University of New South Wales (UNSW). With a shared commitment to promoting accurate and reliable information, we have worked tirelessly to develop a cutting-edge solution that contributes to a more informed and discerning online community. Thank you for joining us in our quest to combat fake news and promote digital integrity. Together, we can make the internet a safer and more reliable space for all.</p>
